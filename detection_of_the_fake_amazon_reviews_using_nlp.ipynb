For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.\\n\\nIt's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)\\n\\nAs I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.\", 'summary': 'A solid overview of Dreamweaver CS5', 'unixReviewTime': 1287532800}, {'overall': 4.0, 'verified': False, 'reviewTime': '10 18, 2010', 'reviewerID': 'A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ', 'asin': '0321719816', 'style': {'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'}, 'reviewerName': 'Grimmy', 'reviewText': 'The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed. The video is closed-captioned. You can set bookmarks. There are self-tests for each chapter as well.\\n\\nStarts off with \"what is HTML\" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on \"the best way to lay out a site using CSS\" or anything like that. For that, you\\'ll need a book or two on that subject.\\n\\nShe has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it\\'s a decent introduction to creating web sites.\\n\\nShe sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking\\'s voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it\\'s not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.\\n\\nUI - at the top of the interface, there\\'s a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you\\'ll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\\n\\nThere\\'s a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you\\'ll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\\n\\nAll in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.', 'summary': 'A good value', 'unixReviewTime': 1287360000}]\n"
